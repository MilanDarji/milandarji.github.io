#Note from the web designer, Milan Darji

## Personal CV Website

This is a minimalist, static website built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
beginning with the template Hyperspace by HTML5 UP, as extensively modified by me, Milan Darji
	Credit for original Hyperspace template: html5up.net | @ajlkn
	Free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)

The site's purpose is to serve as a personal CV and professional landing page.

### Philosophy

- **Simplicity over complexity**: No frameworks, build tools, or dependencies.
- **Clarity over clutter**: Designed for readability, accessibility, and ease of maintenance.
- **Longevity over novelty**: Content changes will be rare and intentional.

### Workflow

- Edited locally using Notepad++
- Version-controlled with Git via WSL
- Deployment target: GitHub Pages (or similar static host)
- Changes are tracked manually and committed with clear messages

### Notes

This site is intentionally lightweight and transparent.  
All content is hand-authored and versioned for clarity and traceability.
